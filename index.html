            <p> <em>Final year student of <strong>Bachlores in Design</strong></em></p>
            <p> I am currently completing my final year of the Bachelor of Design program. I am 
                interested in <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-design"> UX design </a> because the way we experience everything is fascinating. In 
                UX, it's about observing it all, gathering information, reporting, taking as many 
                insights as you can, and then. Improve or create new experiences that are finally in 
                place. It's fun to see how people's lives are improved.
